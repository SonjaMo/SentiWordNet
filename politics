If this was the case why aren't there major Christian and Jewish terrorist groups in the Middle East, North Africa, Indonesia, etc.? Christians and Jews in those regions are persecuted, killed, made fun of, called heretics, spit on, stoned, and so on. It would seem that Christian or Jewish terrorist organizations would form because of those conditions but that is not so. Maybe the problem is with current Muslim and Islamic thinking and not so much with the western world.
